Random Phase Approximation
==========================

The random phase approximation (RPA) is a method to detect the response to the fluctuations of
one-body operators by the effect of electron correlations, starting from the non-interacting
state.
While in the UHF approximation an initial guess of the configuration is required, 
the RPA method enables to infer the ordered phase that emerges from the second-order transition.
H-wave implements RPA method using Matsubara frequency, and allows to compare with the dynamical
observables measured in the experiments by analytical continuation.

In the following, the algorithm is described.
In the RPA mode of H-wave, the Hamiltonian given below will be considered:

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     {\cal H}&={\cal H}_0+{\cal H}_{\rm int},\\
     {\cal H}_0&=\sum_{\langle i\alpha;j\beta \rangle}
      (t_{ij}^{\alpha \beta}c_{i\alpha}^{\dagger}
      c_{j\beta}^{\mathstrut}+\mbox{H.c.}),\\
     {\cal H}_{\rm int}&=\sum_{ij}\sum_{\alpha, \alpha', \beta, \beta'}W_{ij}^{\beta\beta',\alpha\alpha'}\left(
      c_{i\alpha}^{\dagger}c_{i\alpha'}c_{j\beta'}^{\dagger}c_{j\beta}+\mbox{H.c.}\right)
    \end{aligned}

Applying the Fourier transformation

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
    c_{i\alpha}
    =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_L}}\sum_{\bf{k}}
    e^{i \bf{k}\cdot \bf{r}_{i}}c_{\bf{k},\alpha}^{\mathstrut},
    \end{aligned}

the Hamiltonian is rewritten in the following form

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     {\cal H}&=\sum_{{\bf k}\alpha\beta}
     (\varepsilon_{\alpha\beta}({\bf k})c_{{\bf k}\alpha}^{\dagger}
     c_{{\bf k}\beta}^{\mathstrut}+\mbox{H.c.}) \nonumber\\
    &+\frac{1}{2N_L}\sum_{{\bf k} {\bf k}'{\bf q}}\sum_{\alpha\beta\alpha'\beta'}
     W^{\beta\beta',\alpha\alpha'}_{{\bf q}}
     c_{{\bf k}+{\bf q},\alpha}^{\dagger}
      c_{{\bf k},\alpha'}^{\mathstrut}
      c_{{\bf k}'-{\bf q},\beta'}^{\dagger}
      c_{{\bf k}',\beta}^{\mathstrut}
    \end{aligned}

In the random phase approximation, the density fluctuation by the effect of electron correlation
is detected with respect to :math:`{\cal H}_0`.
The scattering by the interaction must therefore be considered on the basis
where :math:`{\cal H}_0` is diagonalize, and thus the interaction term is approximated as

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
    &W^{\beta\beta',\alpha\alpha'}_{\bf{q}}c_{\bf{k}+\bf{q},\alpha}^{\dagger}c_{\bf{k},\alpha'}^{\mathstrut}
    c_{\bf{k}'-\bf{q},\beta'}^{\dagger} c_{\bf{k}',\beta}^{\mathstrut}\nonumber\\
    &\sim W^{\beta\beta',\alpha\alpha'}_{\bf{q}} \sum_{\gamma, \gamma'}
    u_{\alpha \gamma, \bf{k}+\bf{q}}^* d_{\bf{k}+\bf{q},\gamma}^{\dagger}
    u_{\alpha' \gamma, \bf{k}} d_{\bf{k},\gamma}^{\mathstrut}
    u_{\beta' \gamma', \bf{k}'-\bf{q}}^* d_{\bf{k}'-\bf{q},\gamma'}^{\dagger}
    u_{\beta  \gamma', \bf{k}'}d_{\bf{k}',\gamma'}^{\mathstrut}.
    \end{aligned}

Here, 

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
    c_{\bf{k},\alpha} = \sum_{\gamma} u_{\alpha \gamma, \bf{k}} d_{\bf{k}, \gamma}
    \end{aligned}

and :math:`d_{\bf{k}, \gamma}` denotes the annihilation operator that diagonalizes :math:`{\cal H}_0`. (:math:`\gamma` refers to the index of the eigenvalue.)
Then, the irreducible one-body Green's function is written as

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     G^{(0)\alpha\beta}_{\gamma}({\bf k}, i\omega_{n})=
      \frac{u^{\alpha\gamma}({\bf k})u^{*\beta\gamma}({\bf k})}{i\epsilon_{n}-\xi^{\gamma}({\bf k})+\mu}.
    \end{aligned}

The irreducible susceptibility is given in the following form, as it must be closed
within the diagnoalized elements:

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     X^{(0)\alpha\alpha', \beta\beta'}({\bf q},i\omega_n)=
      -\frac{T}{N_L}
      \sum_{\gamma=1}^{n_{\rm orb}}\sum_{{\bf k},n}
      G^{(0)\alpha\beta}_{\gamma}({\bf k}+{\bf q}, i\omega_m+ i\epsilon_{n})
      G^{(0)\beta'\alpha'}_{\gamma}({\bf k}, i\epsilon_{n}),
    \end{aligned}

By using the irreducible susceptibility, the susceptibility matrix from the RPA
is obtained as follows:

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
    X^{\alpha\alpha', \beta\beta'}(q)&=
    X^{(0)\alpha\alpha', \beta\beta'}(q) - \sum_{\alpha_1'\beta_1'}
    X^{(0)\alpha\alpha', \beta_1\beta_1'}(q) W^{\beta_1\beta_1', \alpha_1\alpha_1'}_{\bf q}X^{\alpha_1 \alpha_1' , \beta \beta'}(q),
    \end{aligned}

Combining indices such as :math:`\alpha\alpha^\prime` into one index, they are expressed
in the matrix form. Then finally it leads to the expression:

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     \hat{X}(q)&=\hat{X}^{(0)}(q)-\hat{X}^{(0)}(q)\hat{W}(q)\hat{X}(q)\nonumber\\
     &=\left[\hat{I}+\hat{X}^{(0)}(q)\hat{W}(q)\right]^{-1}\hat{X}^{(0)}(q).
    \end{aligned}

In the above formula, orbitals and spins were treated as unified generalised orbitals.
Of the arrays needed to perform the calculations,
the susceptibility ( :math:`X^{(0)\alpha\alpha^\prime, \beta\beta^\prime}({\bf q},i\omega_n)`, :math:`X^{\alpha\alpha^\prime, \beta\beta^\prime}({\bf q},i\omega_n)`) is the largest multidimensional array,
given by :math:`N_{\rm orb}^4 N_{\rm spin}^4 N_k N_{\omega}`, where the memory cost and computational complexity increase as the size increases.
As explained below, the size of the multidimensional array of susceptibilities can be reduced by separating orbits and spins:
for the two-body interactions handled in H-wave's RPA mode, separating orbits and spins results in

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
    & W^{\beta\sigma_1\sigma_1',\alpha\sigma\sigma'}_{\bf{q}}c_{\bf{k}+\bf{q},\alpha \sigma}^{\dagger}c_{\bf{k},\alpha \sigma'}^{\mathstrut}
    c_{\bf{k}'-\bf{q},\beta\sigma_1'}^{\dagger} c_{\bf{k}',\beta\sigma_1}^{\mathstrut}.
    \end{aligned}

Since the scattering is on the same diagonalized general orbital,
the irreducible susceptibility becomes

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     X^{(0)\alpha, \beta}_{\sigma\sigma'\sigma_1\sigma_1'}({\bf q},i\omega_n)=
      -\frac{T}{N_L}
      \sum_{\gamma=1}^{n_{\rm orb}}\sum_{{\bf k},n}
      G^{(0)\alpha\beta}_{\sigma\sigma_1', \gamma}({\bf k}+{\bf q}, i\omega_m+ i\epsilon_{n})
      G^{(0)\beta\alpha}_{\sigma_1\sigma', \gamma}({\bf k}, i\epsilon_{n}).
    \end{aligned}

The array size can be reduced to :math:`N_{\rm orb}^2 N_{\rm spin}^4 N_k N_{\omega}`.
Then susceptibility matrix by RPA is obtained as follows:

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
    X^{\alpha, \beta}_{\sigma\sigma'\sigma_1\sigma_1'}(q)&=
    X^{(0)\alpha, \beta}_{\sigma\sigma'\sigma_1\sigma_1'}(q) - \sum_{\alpha_1'\beta_1'}
    X^{(0)\alpha, \alpha_2}_{\sigma\sigma'\sigma_2\sigma_2'}(q) W^{\alpha_2, \alpha_3}_{\sigma_2\sigma_2', \sigma_3\sigma_3'}({\bf q})X^{\alpha_3, \beta}_{\sigma_3\sigma_3',\sigma_1\sigma_1'}(q).
    \end{aligned}

If :math:`\alpha\sigma\sigma'` is regarded as a single index,
it can be put into matrix form and, as in the case of generalised orbitals, can be used as a

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     \hat{X}(q)&=\hat{X}^{(0)}(q)-\hat{X}^{(0)}(q)\hat{W}(q)\hat{X}(q)\nonumber\\
     &=\left[\hat{I}+\hat{X}^{(0)}(q)\hat{W}(q)\right]^{-1}\hat{X}^{(0)}(q).
    \end{aligned}

The above formula is the general formula for the RPA method.

In the above formula, the calculation of the irreducible susceptibility is performed as follows:

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     X^{(0)\alpha, \beta}_{\sigma\sigma'\sigma_1\sigma_1'}({\bf q},i\omega_n)=
      -\frac{T}{N_L}
      \sum_{\gamma=1}^{n_{\rm orb}}\sum_{{\bf k},n}
      G^{(0)\alpha\beta}_{\sigma\sigma_1', \gamma}({\bf k}+{\bf q}, i\omega_m+ i\epsilon_{n})
      G^{(0)\beta\alpha}_{\sigma_1\sigma', \gamma}({\bf k}, i\epsilon_{n})\nonumber
    \end{aligned}

In this case, the sum of the diagonalized components is required, which is computationally more expensive.
In many previous studies, the one body Green's function is calculated as follows:

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     G^{(0)\alpha\beta}_{\sigma\sigma'}({\bf k}, i\omega_{n}) = \sum_{\gamma=1}^{n_{\rm orb}} G^{(0)\alpha\beta}_{\sigma\sigma', \gamma}({\bf k}, i\omega_{n}).
    \end{aligned}

The irreducible susceptibility is calculated as follows:

.. math::
    \begin{aligned}
     X^{(0)\alpha, \beta}_{\sigma\sigma'\sigma_1\sigma_1'}({\bf q},i\omega_n)=
      -\frac{T}{N_L}
      \sum_{{\bf k},n}
      G^{(0)\alpha\beta}_{\sigma\sigma_1'}({\bf k}+{\bf q}, i\omega_m+ i\epsilon_{n})
      G^{(0)\beta\alpha}_{\sigma_1\sigma'}({\bf k}, i\epsilon_{n}).\nonumber
    \end{aligned}

Though this method may lead to poor accuracy when the diagonalized components are mixed,
there is an advantage that there is no need for technical consideration for :math:`\gamma` due to band intersections.
In order to make comparisons with previous studies,
H-Wave has adopted this approach (a mode for correctly handling the Green's functions and susceptibilities will also be implemented).
It is noted that the vertex correction may be taken into account as a means to consider
higher order correlations. See, for example, reference [1]_ for the details.
