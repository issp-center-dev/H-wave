What is H-wave?
----------------------------------------------------------------

H-wave is a program to perform unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF) approximation and random phase approximation (RPA) for itinerant electron systems.
It is based on mean field approximation, and it enables calculations of complicated Hamiltonian and large lattices at low compuational cost.
